# Portfolio
 
 ## Intent
 This is a documented skeleton portflio designed so anyone can plug in their information, adjust to their ideal colours, and get started with their own website. 

 This allows a user greater access to the web, accounts for development concerns, show of work, and the ability to view projects with ease. At current, it does not contain any links to projects or images. The user will need to input those where noted as they wish for their convenience. 

Likewise, the colours can be changed in order to create an intrinsically creative design. I myself am colourblind so I imagine I do not perform well in creating an aesthetic atmosphere. 

It is to note that as of current, links on the navigation bar and sections do not work and are not currently filled. At this time, I am unsure of why there is a reoccuring error. However, the navigation will be responsive and tapping the top right corner will allow for a drop down menu interface. 

It also has a fixed footer to allow your license to come through clearly at the bottom of the page. 

## Images
Images of the Website iteration can be found within the CSS folder as a png for viewership.
